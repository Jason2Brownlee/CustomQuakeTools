Ideas for helpful scripts I may write in the future.


Scripts Ideas
-------------

- Script to scan contents of all zip files in a directory for keywords (e.g. bots).
- Script to check if any files listed on FTP HTML page are not in a local directory.
- Script to automatically take a screenshot from intermission camera in a BSP file.


Improvements
------------

- Download files using multiple threads to speed things up.
- Change absolute urls to relative urls when downloading a website from archive.org
	- Write a new script to do this?
