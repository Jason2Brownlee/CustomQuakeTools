Ideas for helpful scripts I may write in the future.


Scripts Ideas
-------------

- Script to automatically take a screenshot from intermission camera in a BSP file.
- Script to automatically search google groups and parse the results.


Improvements
------------

- Download files using multiple threads to speed things up.
- Change absolute urls to relative urls when downloading a website from archive.org
	- Write a new script to do this?
- Support rar and arj files when searching zip files (many bbs archives are .zip around a .arj).
